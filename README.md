#FAQ

##What is the [UT Robotics and Automation Society](http://ras.ece.utexas.edu/) (UT RAS)?
RAS is an organization for students passionate about robotics.
They do various projects to give students an interdisciplinary and hands-on understanding of all the different aspects of robotics. They have some social events and  networking events as well.
All majors are welcome to join, especially those who are interested in a future with robotics or are just curious about the field.

##What is Robotathon?
Robotathon is the biggest event that UT RAS does.
It is a crash course in all things robotics.
Every fall semester incoming freshman (or others that have little robotics experience) compete in teams to solve a particular challenge.
By the end of the semester, each team has its own robot that they have built and programmed from scratch.
Itâ€™s a great way to learn about robots, and it is a lot of fun.
